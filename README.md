# 🩺 IDC-Net: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) Classification using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
Monitoring and diagnosing **Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)**—the most common form of breast cancer—is critical for early intervention. This project implements a deep learning pipeline to automatically classify histopathology image patches as either **IDC Negative** or **IDC Positive**.

The models are trained to recognize microscopic cellular patterns that distinguish cancerous tissue from healthy tissue, specifically focusing on IDC which often characterizes more advanced stages of breast cancer.

## 📂 Dataset: Breast Histopathology Images
The project utilizes the **IDC Regular PS50** dataset, consisting of over **277,000 image patches** (50x50 pixels).
- **Class 0**: Non-IDC (Benign)
- **Class 1**: IDC (Malignant)

The dataset is organized by Patient IDs, allowing for robust testing and validation.

## Methodology & Models
We employ **Transfer Learning** with two state-of-the-art architectures optimized for efficient execution on standard hardware (including CPU-only systems):

1.  **VGG16**: Optimized for texture and spatial pattern recognition.
2.  **ResNet50**: Utilizes deep residual learning to benchmark performance.

### Efficiency Optimizations:
- **Parallel Training**: Scripts are provided to train both models simultaneously.
- **Explainability**: Integrated **Grad-CAM** visualization shows which specific cellular regions influenced the model's decision.

##  How to Run & Test

### 1️. Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️. Download Data
If you haven't already, download the IDC dataset:
```bash
kaggle datasets download -d paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images -p data/breast_histopathology --unzip
```

### 3️. Launch the Diagnostic App
Run the interactive Streamlit web application:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### 🧪 How to Test the Models
1.  Once the app is running, use the sidebar to **Load the VGG16 Model**.
2.  **Option A (Auto-Sample):** Click the "Load Random Sample" button to pull an image directly from the dataset.
3.  **Option B (Manual):** Drag and drop any `.png` file from `data/breast_histopathology/10253/1/` (Malignant) or `data/breast_histopathology/10253/0/` (Benign) into the upload box.
4.  Click **Predict** to see the result and the **Grad-CAM heatmap**.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated on:
- **Sensitivity (Recall)**: Critical for minimizing false negatives in cancer detection.
- **ROC-AUC**: Measuring the overall discriminative power.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizing classification errors.
